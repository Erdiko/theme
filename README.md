# Theme

Erdiko theming engine

erdiko/theme is a lightweight package that allows you to build twig themes faster and more effectively.

This is a work in progress as we move erdiko to Slim PHP we are also migrating the erdiko theming engine to twig.  Sorry, not quite ready for prime time.  We will integrate this package into erdiko in April 2017 (alpha) and have the full beta ready sometime in May 2017.

erdiko/theme will work well with Slim PHP and erdiko as well as easy to adapt to other PHP frameworks.


## Installation

Easy installation via composer

```
composer require erdiko/theme
```


## Twig 

Twig is a modern template engine for PHP http://twig.sensiolabs.org/ We were so impressed by the features and adoption of it that we ditched our template engine in favor of twig.  erdiko/theme will leverage the flexibility of twig and allow you to build themes more efficiently.


## Themes

We will have 3 starter themes at V1.

1. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 

2. [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) 

3. [Blog](https://github.com/ArroyoLabs/erdiko-wordpress) (built on bootstrap and perfect for headless WordPress)


## Feedback

We would love to hear more about how we can make your theme development easier.  Please send us your comments, feature requests, and any bug reports.
